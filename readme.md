# React Playground

Welcome to **React Playground**! This is a personal project where I experiment with React and AI-driven features, exploring new ideas and building fun prototypes. The codebase is intentionally playful and may include rapid iterations, experimental components, and creative styling.

## What is this?

- A playground for learning and testing React concepts
- A space to try out AI integrations and generative UI ideas
- Not a production-ready appâ€”just for fun and exploration

## Features

- Modern React (with hooks, functional components, and TypeScript)
- Modular SCSS for styling
